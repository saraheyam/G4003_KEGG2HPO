Besides, a minority of patients with MF (most of them negative for the JAK2 mutation) harbor other JAK-STAT-activating mutation, the MPL mutation, in the gene of the receptor of the thrombopoietin. Recently, mutations in the CALR gene have been described in 86% of cases with primary MF that are negative for JAK2 or MPL mutations. CALR mutation also showed cytokine independent growth of cells due to activation of STAT5 involved with the JAK-STAT pathway but its exact role in MPN remains to be clarified.""",Cancer; Hematologic disease,,"""MPL [HSA:4352] [KO:K05082], JAK2 [HSA:3717] [KO:K04447], CALR [HSA:811] [KO:K08057]""",,,,,"""Ruxolitinib [DR:D09960], Fedratinib [DR:D10630]""",ICD-0-3: 9961/3 Primary myelofibrosis,"""ICD-10: C94.4 D47.4 D75.8, MeSH: D055728"""

Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, full-length mHtt can interfere with BDNF vesicular transport on microtubules. This mutant protein also may lead to abnormal endocytosis and secretion in neurons, because normal Htt form a complex with the proteins Hip1, clathrin and AP2 that are involved in endocytosis. In addition, mHtt affects Ca2+ signaling by sensitizing InsP3R1 to activation by InsP3, stimulating NMDAR activity, and destabilizing mitochondrial Ca2+ handling. The mHtt translocates to the nucleus, where it forms intranuclear inclusions. Nuclear toxicity is believed to be caused by interference with gene transcription, leading to loss of transcription of neuroprotective molecules such as BDNF.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the oldest recognized eating disorder. The salient features of this eating disorder are a relentless pursuit of thinness, accompanied by a fear of becoming fat despite being markedly underweight. In women, anorexia nervosa is associated with global endocrine dysregulation, including hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction and alterations in adipokine and appetite regulating hormone levels. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is defined by eating behaviors that include episodes of binge eating which are followed by recurrent self-induced vomiting performed in an attempt to avoid weight gain from the caloric overload. Binge eating disorder (BED) is currently characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating occurring at least twice a week for 6 months or longer. In contrast to bulimia nervosa, there are no inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as vomiting. Eating disorders frequently develop during adolescence or early adulthood, but some studies have reported their onset during childhood or later in adulthood. There is growing evidence supporting a multifactorial etiology that includes genetic, neurochemical, and physiological components for eating disorders above and beyond the more conventional theories based on psychological and sociocultural factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in regulating nerves in the brain. Recent studies have provided evidence that BDNF also plays a role in regulating eating behaviors.

Less frequently, Chiari malformations are acquired after birth. Causes of acquired Chiari malformations involve injuries, exposure to harmful substances, infections. More rarely, chronic subdural hematoma can be the cause of progressive caudal descent of the cerebellar tonsils. Chiari malformations were classified by Hans Chiari in 1891, into four groups. Chiari malformation type I (CM I), the most frequent of Chiari malformations, is characterized by the inferior displacement of cerebellar tonsillas through the foramen magnum. This leads to different symptoms and clinical features, such as headaches, syringomyelia, and hydrocephalus. CM II is characterized by displacement of the parts of the inferior vermis, pons, and medulla oblongata together with elongation of the fourth ventricle. Most cases are associated with myelomeningocele.

There are no definitive treatments for ASO. The efficacy of surgical treatment is not satisfactory, and medication is required to maintain the postoperative vascular patency. In order to relieve symptoms such as cold sensation and intermittent claudication, drug therapy such as antiplatelet therapy and vasodilatory drugs are useful in the treatment of some patients with ASO. Adsorption of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has also been applied for the treatment of ASO. At present, the diagnosis of ASO depends on several clinical tests, such as angiography, estimations of ankle/brachial index (ABI), and pulse-wave velocity (PWV), as well as the measurement of circulating hs-CRP levels.

Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate.

Blepharitis can be classified into anterior blepharitis and posterior blepharitis. Anterior blepharitis describes inflammation of the eyelid skin and eyelash follicles and may be accompanied by squamous debris or collarettes. Anterior blepharitis has classically been associated with Staphylococcus infection and seborrheic dermatitis. Posterior blepharitis describes inflammation of the meibomian glands and their orifices and may be a result of or cause of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). MGD is one cause of posterior blepharitis but others include infectious or allergic conjunctivitis, and rosacea. The diagnosis of blepharitis is almost always based on the history and clinical examination. Long-term management of symptoms may include daily eyelid cleansing routines and the use of therapeutic agents that reduce infection and inflammation.

Despite the apparent structural and biochemical similarities between the BLM, WRN and RECQ4 proteins, the phenotypes of BS, WS and RTS are different, suggesting that each disease pathway is functionally distinct to some extent. BS is characterized by most prominently, a predisposition to all types of cancers. WS is characterized by the premature development of features that resemble aging. RTS is characterized by skin and skeletal abnormalities, signs of premature aging, and cancer predisposition, especially to osteosarcomas. Recent research has shown many connections between all three proteins and the regulation of excess HR (Homologous recombination).

Symptomatic patients generally report an abrupt onset of disease characterised by high fever, polyarthralgia, backache, headache, and fatigue. Fever and characteristic clinical symptoms appear within 4-7 days. Polyarthralgia is reported in 87-98% of cases and represents the most characteristic symptom. In children, clinical manifestations of chikungunya fever appear to be quite specific. The main clinical characteristics in infants are the high prevalence of dermatological manifestations (hyperpigmentation, generalised erythema, maculopapular rash and vesicuobullous lesions) and neurological complications (encephalitis, seizures, meningeal syndrome or acute encephalopathy).

EGPA is characterized by asthma, hypereosinophilia, and extravascular eosinophilic granulomas. Clinically, three phases may be distinguished. The prodromal phase may persist for many years, consisting of asthma possibly associated with allergic rhinitis and often complicated by recurrent rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. The second phase is characterized by peripheral blood eosinophilia or eosinophilic tissue infiltrates. The third phase is dominated by manifestations resulting from systemic vasculitis. Vasculitis commonly affects the skin, nerves, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. It can be serious and life-threatening. EGPA pathogenesis is not well known. The disease is probably the result of a complex interaction in which genetically and environmental factors lead to an inflammatory response whose principal players are eosinophils, T, and B lymphocytes. HLA-DRB1 and DRB4 alleles and IL10.2 haplotype of the IL-10 promoter gene are the most studied genetic determinants.

Although the recurrence risk for congenital hydrocephalus excluding X-linked hydrocephalus is low, recently, a few genes for autosomal recessive congenital hydrocephalus have been identified.

The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction.

These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE).

PM and DM, along with sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM), belong to the heterogeneous group of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), which are characterized by weakness and chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle. PM and DM differ in their clinical features, histopathology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Although their clinical pictures differ, they both present with symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness. PM is a term that was used traditionally to denote all IIMs that were not DM or sIBM, but it is now a controversial entity with questionable specificity. Traditionally, PM is described as presenting with weakness of the proximal muscles that evolves over weeks to months and affects adults, but rarely children. DM typically includes subacute progressive proximal muscle weakness and a skin rash. The disease mechanisms of PM and DM that cause muscle damage and dysfunction are not fully understood. However, because of the association with other autoimmune diseases, the presence of autoantibodies, and response to immunosuppressive medication, they are believed to be autoimmune in origin. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the innate immune system and non-immune mechanisms and described novel adaptive immune-based pathways in the pathogenesis of PM and DM. Treatment of inflammatory myopathies is generally empirical. Corticosteroids still remain the agents of choice for the initial treatment, but their use is limited by the high frequency of side effects. In addition, as a substantial number of patients do not respond to glucocorticoids alone, additional agents such as immunosuppressants, immunomodulators, and more recently, biologics are commonly used in clinical practice.""",Musculoskeletal disease; Nervous system disease; Skin and connective tissue disease,,,,,,,"""Hydrocortisone [DR:D00088], Betamethasone [DR:D00244], Human normal immunoglobulin [DR:D08783], Eculizumab [DR:D03940]""","""Autoantigen: HARS [HSA:3035] [KO:K01892], TARS [HSA:6897] [KO:K01868], AARS [HSA:16] [KO:K01872], GARS [HSA:2617] [KO:K01880], IARS [HSA:3376] [KO:K01870], NARS [HSA:4677] [KO:K01893], FARSA [HSA:2193] [KO:K01889], FARSB [HSA:10056] [KO:K01890], IFIH1 [HSA:64135] [KO:K12647], TRIM33 [HSA:51592] [KO:K08883], MORC3 [HSA:23515], SAE1 [HSA:10055] [KO:K10684], SAE2 [HSA:10054] [KO:K10685]""","""ICD-10: M33, MeSH: D017285 D003882"""

The prime determinant of free water excretion is the regulation of urinary flow by circulating levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in plasma. Disorders of water metabolism can be divided into hyperosmolar disorders, in which there is a deficiency of body water relative to body solute, and hypo-osmolar disorders, in which there is an excess of body water relative to body solute. The classical hyperosmolar disorder is diabetes insipidus (DI), and the classical hypo-osmolar disorder is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). DI can result from either inadequate AVP secretion (central or neurogenic DI) or inadequate renal response to AVP (nephrogenic DI).

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal malformation in newborns. Throughout the world, the overall prevalence of DS is 1 per 1,000 live births, although in recent years this figure has been increasing. Roughly 95% of cases of DS are due to the presence of an extra (third) copy of HSA21.  Most often, the non-disjunction event leading to DS occurs in maternal meiosis I. In about 5% of patients, 1 copy is translocated to another acrocentric chromosome, most often chromosome 14 or 21. In 2 to 4% of cases with free trisomy 21 there is recognizable mosaicism for a trisomic and a normal cell line. DS occurs at a much higher incidence in older mothers. Nonetheless, the vast majority of DS births are to younger mothers. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that age independent DNA hypo-methylation is associated with chromosomal instability and abnormal segregation. Recent studies have linked the increased frequency of polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase gene (MTRR) in mothers with DS child. The phenotypic features of DS are quite variable from person to person and include learning disability, heart defects, early-onset Alzheimer's disease and childhood leukaemia. This phenotypic variation is likely to be caused by a combination of environmental and genetic causes. Genetic polymorphisms in both Hsa21 and non-Hsa21 genes may account for much of this variation. Trisomy of Hsa21 has a significant impact on the development of many tissues, most notably the heart and the brain.

It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and subacute inflammation of the ocular surface. Dry eye disease is subdivided into two forms, aqueous insufficiency (tear deficiency) and hyperevaporative (increased evaporation). However, mixed forms are common. Aqueous insufficiency is divided into two main groups: Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye and non-Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye (which includes the use of systemic medication). Dry eye in Sjogren's syndrome (an autoimmune disease) is often severe and requires more aggressive treatment. Evapourative dry eye is most commonly a result of meibomian gland dysfunction. Tests used to diagnose dry eye disease and to assess efficacy of treatments in clinical trials include the following: measurement of tear film break-up time (the interval between the individual's last complete blink and the break up of the tear film) using fluorescein (shortened in dry eye disease), evaluation of tear quantity with Schirmer's test (using a strip of filter paper placed under the lower eyelid), assessment of corneal and conjunctival epithelium integrity using stains and dyes, and evaluation of meibomian glands. Artificial tears of various kinds are recommended if the symptoms are mild. Lid hygiene is helpful in the treatment of hyperevaporative dry eye, while collagen or silicon plugs can be used for partial occlusion of the efferent lacrimal ducts to treat severe hyposecretory dry eye.

In women, anorexia nervosa is associated with global endocrine dysregulation, including hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction and alterations in adipokine and appetite regulating hormone levels.

In contrast to bulimia nervosa, there are no inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as vomiting.

EM major has mucous membrane involvement. The oral mucosa is most commonly affected, initially with edema that progresses to superficial erosions. Other surfaces that might be involved include the anogenital, ocular, and nasal mucosa. Although previously thought to be on a similar continuum of EM, and histologically appearing the same, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is increasingly being considered a separate disease process. It is currently believed that EM is a result of an immune reaction to an inciting infectious or pharmacologic antigen. The most common infectious organisms in EM are herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia. The first line of treatment for EM is removal of the inciting factor when possible.

The pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis is not fully understood but postulated mechanisms include hyperlipidemia, fat emboli and intravascular coagulation that reduce the supply of blood to the bones. Since not all patients who are treated with steroids develop osteonecrosis, the presence of additional risk factors or individual variation of glucocorticoids sensitivity has been suggested. The risks of this disease include advancing age, prolonged duration of treatment, increased daily dosage and cumulative dose, low body mass index, underlying disease, and polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor.

The most malignant form of infiltrating astrocytoma - glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) - is one of the most aggressive human cancers. GBM may develop de novo (primary glioblastoma) or by progression from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastoma).  Primary glioblastomas develop in older patients and typically show genetic alterations (EGFR amplification, p16/INK4a deletion, and PTEN mutations) at frequencies of 24-34%. Secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients and frequently show overexpression of PDGF and CDK4 as well as p53 mutations (65%) and loss of Rb playing major roles in such transformations.

Because of the critical interaction between an intrinsic antigen (galactose-deficient IgA1) and circulating anti-glycan antibodies, IgA nephropathy can be considered an autoimmune disease. Since the features of IgA nephropathy identified by light microscopy are nonspecific, immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase studies demonstrating a predominant deposition of IgA are essential to establish a definitive diagnosis of IgA nephropathy.

Classification of MPGN has been updated in the 2010s, and is now categorized according to the immunofluorescence microscopy findings. Until recently, the MPGNs have been distinguished according to the histological and ultra structural findings and were classified as MPGN type I, type II and type III. A new terminology that distinguishes immunoglobulin-mediated MPGN (ie, the former type I) from complement-mediated MPGN has been proposed. Immune-complexes mediated MPGN is caused by the deposition of immunocomplexes in the glomeruli. The immunocomplexes activate the classical pathway (CP) of complement and cause the deposition of complement factors or of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the mesangium and capillary loops. The most frequent underlying disorders associated with immune complex MPGN include chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and monoclonal gammopathies. The complement-mediated MPGN, termed C3 glomerulopathy, is characterised by defects in the alternative pathway of complement, in particular of factor H, or autoantibodies to complement-regulatory proteins (so-called C3 nephritic factors) leading to increased complement activation. The group includes dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis.

Damaged tissues secrete inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha ). During step 2, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) trigger the activation of donor-derived T cells, which induce further T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1.

Its clinical presentation is variable and ranges from isolated skin or bone disease to a life-threatening multisystem condition. Historically, it has been hypothesized that the disease originated from epidermal Langerhans cells. However, new evidence supports a model in which LCH occurs as a consequence of a misguided differentiation programme of myeloid dendritic cell precursors. In LCH, there is a very high frequency of activating mutations in MAPK signaling pathway genes, most notably BRAF-V600E, as well as MAP2K1. Genetic, molecular and functional data implicate activation of the MAPK (ERK) signalling pathway at critical stages in myeloid differentiation as an essential and universal driver of LCH pathology.""",Cancer,,"""BRAF (mutation) [HSA:673] [KO:K04365], MAP2K1 (mutation) [HSA:5604] [KO:K04368]""",,,,"""CD1a [HSA:909] [KO:K06448], CD207 [HSA:50489] [KO:K06561]""","""Vinblastine [DG:DG00689], Prednisone [DG:DG00094], Mercaptopurine [DG:DG00683]""","""ICD-O-3: 9752/1 Langerhans cell histiocytosis, unifocal, ICD-O-3: 9753/1 Langerhans cell histiocytosis, multifocal, ICD-O-3: 9754/3 Langerhans cell histiocytosis, disseminated""","""ICD-10: C96.0 C96.5 C96.6, MeSH: D006646"""

Two types of HIV has been characterized. HIV-1 is the most virulent and pathogenic strain. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.""",Infectious disease,,,"""  Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) [GN:T40001], Human immunodeficiency virus 2 (HIV-2) [GN:T40002]""",,,,"""Zidovudine [DR:D00413] Didanosine [DR:D00296] Zalcitabine [DR:D00412] Sanilvudine [DR:D00445] Lamivudine [DR:D00353] Abacavir [DR:D00891] Emtricitabine [DR:D01199] Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [DR:D01982] (NRTIs), Nevirapine [DR:D00435] Efavirenz [DR:D00896] Delavirdine [DR:D00895] Etravirine [DR:D04112] Rilpivirine [DR:D09958] (NNRTIs), Ritonavir [DR:D00427] Nelfinavir [DR:D00899] Saquinavir [DR:D01160] Fosamprenavir [DR:D02867] (PIs), Raltegravir [DR:D07133] Dolutegravir [DR:D10113] (Integra",See also H00406 Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).,"""ICD-10: B24, MeSH: D015658"""

HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE.

Anterior pituitary is composed of five cell types that secrete growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and corticotropin hormone (ACTH). Clinical manifestations of hypopituitarism are variable, often insidious in onset and dependent on the degree and severity of hormone deficiency. However, it is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. A variety of diseases may cause hypopituitarism and, accordingly, this disorder can be divided into two types depending on its cause. Primary hypopituitarism is caused by disorders of the pituitary gland itself and may be due to the loss, damage, or dysfunction of pituitary hormone-secreting cells. On the other hand, secondary hypopituitarism is the result of diseases of the hypothalamus or pituitary stalk interrupting the nerve or vascular connections to the pituitary gland, thereby reducing the secretion of the pituitary hormones. Hypopituitarism can be easily diagnosed by measuring basal pituitary and target hormone levels. MR imaging of the hypothalamo-pituitary region may provide essential information. The most common causes of primary hypopituitarism are pituitary adenoma and complications from surgery or radiation therapy for the treatment of pituitary adenoma. In rare cases, hypopituitarism has been observed when the infection occurs. Sheehan's syndrome is hypopituitarism caused by the postpartum hemorrhage of the pituitary gland. In still rarer cases, solitary or complicated pituitary hormone deficiency syndromes may occur due to genetic causes and typically affect children.

Clinically, LEMS patients suffer from characteristic muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms. The underlying cause of LEMS in slightly more than half of all patients is small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) [DS:H00013]. The nerve terminal and carcinoma cells apparently share a common antigen (VGCC), suggesting an immunological cross-reactivity that may lead to the neurological abnormality. Cancer therapy is the priority for these patients. As for the remaining cases, no antibodies to P/Q-type VGCCs have been found in 10-15% of patients with LEMS. The fact that these seronegative patients positively respond to immunotherapy leads to the presumption that antibodies to other proteins might play a role in LEMS. Diagnosis of LEMS is ascertained on the basis of clinical symptoms and is further supported by electrophysiological and serological tests. The clinical triad in LEMS consists of weakness predominantly affecting proximal muscle groups, autonomic dysfunctions, and areflexia.

The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22.  The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1.

However, ATL cells do not always need Tax expression in the later stage of leukemogenesis. Genetic and epigenetic changes should be implicated in such multistep leukemogenesis. Regarding genetic changes, mutation of p53, and deletion of p16 have been reported in ATL. Mutations of Fas gene are also reported in patients with ATL cells. However, such genetic changes were not frequently detected. In this regard, epigenetic change of p16/INK4A gene was more frequent in ATL cells, and accumulated according to the disease progression.

It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder.

The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs.

Patients spend a significant amount of time each day picking their skin, that causes psychosocial impairment. Triggers to pick vary greatly. For example, stress, anxiety, boredom, and feeling tired or angry have all been reported as triggers. Co-occurring psychiatric conditions are common in this disease. The most commonly reported comorbid conditions are trichotillomania, substance dependence, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). So far, there is no clear neurobiological explanation for the etiology of this disease. Recent research showed bilateral abnormalities in the anterior cingulate cortex and abnormalities on the left temporoparietal junction. Another study has shown deficits in motor inhibition, which appears to be correlated with frontal cortex abnormalities. Furthermore, severity of excoriation disorder may be associated with higher levels of impulsivity. Treatment for this disease has largely focused on cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacology. Early psychosocial treatment studies provided evidence for skin picking reduction with habit reversal or acceptance-enhanced behavior therapy (AEBT). The data for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) efficacy in this disease are not convincing, although some studies suggested that fluoxetine is effective.

The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.""",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,,,,,,,"""Clobetasol [DR:D01272], Betamethasone [DR:D01637], Halobetasol [DR:D04409], Diflorasone [DR:D01327], Calcipotriol [DR:D01125], Salicylic acid [DR:D00097], Dithranol [DR:D00233], Coal tar [DR:D03573], Tazarotene [DR:D01132], Tacrolimus [DR:D00107 D08556]""",,"""ICD-10: L40, MeSH: D011565"""

Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes.

It tends to be painful to touch during the acute phase and can eventually become so clinically striking that the patient may become ostracized.  Untreated pellagra results in death from multiorgan failure. Pellagra used to be a disease of epidemic proportions in the developed world.

Diseases in this group include bullous pemphigoid (BP), dermatitis herpetiformis, mucous membrane pemphigois, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, herpes gestationis, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. BP is the most common acquired bullous autoimmune dermatosis disease. It is primarily a disease of the elderly with an equal incidence in men and women. The clinical characteristics are the formation of tense blisters and pruritic urticarial erythema. Histopathologically, subepidermal blister formation associated with eosinophil infiltration is commonly observed in BP. The main autoantigens targeted by BP autoantibodies are hemidesmosomal transmembrane collagen XVII (COL17, also known as BP180/BPAG2) and the intracytoplasmic plakin family protein BP230. Most of these antibodies belong to the immunoglobulin G class. Diagnosis of BP relies on the clinical and histological aspects, but the most reliable clues are given by direct and indirect immunofluorescence. Three types of drugs, with distinct mechanisms of action, are used to treat BP: anti-inflammatory drugs, drugs designed to reduce the production of pathogenic antibodies, and treatments that increase the elimination of pathogenic antibodies from the serum of patients, such as high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy and therapeutic plasma exchange.""",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,,,,,,,,"""Autoantigen: BP180 [HSA:1308] [KO:K07603], BP230 [HSA:667] [KO:K10382], LAMA3 [HSA:3909] [KO:K06240], LAMB3 [HSA:3914] [KO:K06244], ITGA6 [HSA:3655] [KO:K06485], ITGB4 [HSA:3691] [KO:K06525], COL7A1 [HSA:1294] [KO:K16628], TGM3 [HSA:7053] [KO:K05620]""","""ICD-10: L12, MeSH: D010391"""

Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF).

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the predominant tumor type in penile cancer, accounting for 95% of cases. Penile cancers are thought to arise from the progression of precursor lesions and can be subdivided into human papilloma virus (HPV) positive and HPV negative cases. Most common disrupted pathways, both in HPV-mediated and HPV-independent penile carcinogenesis, involve the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 and/or p16INK4a/cyclin D/Rb pathways. HPVs exert their oncogenic effect by expressing the oncoproteins E6 and E7, which bind to and inactivate the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor gene products, respectively. HPV independent mechanisms of pathway inactivation include silencing of the p16INK4a gene by promoter hypermethylation, somatic mutations of the p53 gene, over-expression of MDM2 and mutation of p14ARF. Several other molecular events include alterations in the activity and/or expression of ras and myc genes, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX) pathway and prostaglandin E2 synthase.

The cause of PR is uncertain but epidemiological (seasonal variation and clustering in communities) and clinical features suggest an infective agent. Light and electron microscopy findings suggest infection with human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6/7). HHV-6 and HHV-7 may also interact with each other, explaining recurrences and atypical presentations. PR is self limiting and resolves within one to three months. It typically starts with the development of a large erythematous scaly plaque also called the herald patch or mother patch on trunk or neck, which is followed by an eruption of multiple secondary small erythematous scaly lesions located predominantly on the trunk and following the lines of cleavage on the back (Christmas tree or inverted fir tree appearance). Collarette scaling is seen typically. The eruption is usually preceded by a prodrome of sore throat, gastrointestinal disturbance, fever, and arthralgia. A case of PR is diagnosed mainly on clinical grounds. A biopsy is needed in atypical cases, and it mainly helps in excluding other differentials rather than diagnosing PR as the histopathological examination in a case of PR is relatively nonspecific and resembles a subacute or chronic dermatitis. As PR is a self-limiting disorder, most patients just need to be counseled regarding the natural course of the disease instead of putting them on an aggressive treatment protocol. Most patients would just need emollients, antihistaminics, and sometimes topical steroids to control pruritus.""",Skin and connective tissue disease,,,"""  Human herpesvirus 6B [GN:T40075], Human herpesvirus 7 [GN:T40076]""",,,,,,"""ICD-10: L42, MeSH: D017515"""

The prototypical clinical characteristics of PRP are follicular hyperkeratotic papules on an erythematous base that can eventually coalesce to large red plaques. Its classification into five subgroups is based on age at onset, clinical course, morphologic features, and prognosis. More than 50% of patients are best classified as type I with adult-onset PRP. It is comprised of widespread, follicular papules and plaques and tends to clear spontaneously in 80% of patients in one to three years. Type II, which is the atypical adult subtype, tends to be more chronic and presents with areas of alopecia, eczematous patches, and a palmoplantar keratoderma. The classic juvenile type III is observed in only 10% of patients. It is similar clinically to type I but occurs in children and tends to remit in one year. Type IV, which is the circumscribed, juvenile subtype, presents with sharply-demarcated areas of follicular hyperkeratosis and erythema of the elbows and knees. An estimated 5% of children with PRP develop an atypical form classified as juvenile type V. Most familial cases that are published belong to this group. Recently, the designation of a new category of PRP (type VI) has been proposed that is characterized by the presence of HIV infection with different clinical features and a poorer prognosis. Treatment of PRP can be difficult, and no standardized approach has been established, although systemic retinoids are considered first-line therapy.

Type 4 RTA is a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with hyperkalemia due to aldosterone deficiency or impairment in aldosterone molecular signaling. Primary pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is characterized by salt-wasting, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis in the presence of markedly elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration. In the autosomal dominant form, aldosterone resistance is due to heterozygous mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene. In the autosomal recessive form, aldosterone resistance is caused by loss-of-function homozygous mutations in the genes encoding one of the three constitutive subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) of the epithelial Na+ channel (SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G). Other inherited cause of type 4 RTA includes hyperkalaemia associated with hypertension and low or normal levels of plasma aldosterone. This syndrome is called pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHA2), or Gordon's syndrome, which results in a renal aldosterone resistance. Mutations in the genes encoding WNK1 and WNK4 kinases (WNK1 and WNK4), which regulate ion-transportors on renal tubules, were identified in patients with PHA2. Acquired hyperkalemic RTA is observed in the context of mineralocorticoid deficiency, systemic lupus erythematosus, and AIDS nephropathy.

Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues.

The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons.

Most congenital scoliosis is often recognized at birth, but more subtle spinal defects can remain undetected. A close interaction of genes and environment regulates the development of normal spine. Developmental studies in animal models have identified many genes regulating somite formation and segmentation. Patients with congenital scoliosis frequently have other associated anomalies. Sometimes rib fusion or absence can be observed along with the spinal anomalies since ribs are formed in close association with the vertebrae. When the number of ribs on the right or left side do not match, congenital vertebral anomalies should be suspected. An extensive thoracic congenital scoliosis associated with fused ribs may affect thoracic function and the growth of the lungs in young children and lead to a thoracic insufficiency syndrome.

However, this role of vitamin C does not explain all of the manifestations associated with scurvy. At-risk groups include the poor (because of reduced access to groceries), food faddists, and individuals with purported allergies to multiple fruit and vegetable products. Other at-risk groups include persons with gastrointestinal disease (e.g. colitis), anatomical abnormalities, poor dentition, cancer patients on chemotherapy, patients on hemodialysis, and psychiatric disorders (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, or anorexia). Alcoholic persons represent one of the largest groups at risk for scurvy because they may have poorly balanced diets and because alcohol decreases the absorption of vitamin C.

Patients might report numbness, coordination and gait issues, grip weakness and bowel and bladder complaint. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a major cause of pain and functional disability for the elderly. Neurogenic claudication symptoms are a hallmark of lumbar spinal stenosis, where patients develop low back or leg pain when walking or standing that is relieved by sitting or lumbar flexion. The treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis generally begins with conservative management such as physical therapy, home exercise programs, and oral analgesics. Once these therapies fail, patients commonly move forward with interventional pain treatment options such as epidural steroid injections (ESIs), nerve block, or surgery as the next step. Coexisting lumbar and cervical stenosis (tandem spinal stenosis) is an infrequent presentation with mixed presentation of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron signs.

Only females are found in the host where they are embedded in the duodenum and jejunum mucosa, producing eggs. These hatch, develop into infective larvae and penetrate the intestinal mucosa or perianal skin.

It is an uncommon but important cause of fever of unknown origin (FUO). SAT is often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection and occurs concurrently with outbreaks of viral diseases (mumps, measles, influenza). However, the exact etiology is unknown. Clinically, it presents with acute onset of pain in the thyroid region. The pain may be exacerbated by turning the head or swallowing, and may radiate to the jaw, ear or chest. Common initial clinical features include low-grade fever, fatigue, and mild thyrotoxic manifestations. The physical examination, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an elevated thyroglobulin level, and a depressed radioactive iodine uptake confirm the diagnosis. Therapy with antithyroid drugs is not indicated in patients with SAT because this disorder is caused by the release of preformed thyroid hormone rather than synthesis of new T3 and T4. Therapy with beta blockers may be indicated for the symptomatic treatment of thyrotoxicosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are generally effective in reducing thyroid pain in patients with mild cases.

The term thyrotoxicosis is not synonymous with hyperthyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis is defined as the clinical syndrome of hypermetabolism resulting from increased thyroid hormone levels, irrespective of the source. The causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary toxic adenoma. Less common causes of hyperthyroidism include thyrotropin-induced thyrotoxicosis and trophoblastic tumours. The causes of thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism are less common and generally transient. In patients with silent thyroiditis, post-partum thyroiditis, or subacute painful thyroiditis, the destruction of thyrocytes leads to release of preformed hormones into the circulation. Drug-induced thyrotoxicosis has the same pathogenic mechanism as thyroiditis. Exogenous thyrotoxicosis develops after ingestion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, and is associated with low serum thyroglobulin concentrations. Patients of hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis usually have fatigue, nervousness or anxiety, weight loss, palpitations, and heat sensitivity. Clinical findings almost always include tachycardia, warm moist skin, the presence of an enlarged thyroid, and a slight tremor. The three options for treating patients with hyperthyroidism are antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. All three therapeutic options would be effective in the treatment of patients with Graves' disease, whereas patients with toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter should have either radioactive iodine therapy or surgery, since these patients rarely go into remission.

SS may occur as a primary disorder or in association with other systemic autoimmune diseases, traditionally defined as secondary SS, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Salivary secretions from these patients exhibit elevated levels of antibodies and cytokines. This is accompanied by a reduction in oral phosphate levels and xerostomia due to reduced salivary flow, which can lead to infections, progressive caries, dysphagia and oral pain. Current tests for SS include sialometry, salivary scintigraphy, sialography, serological tests or minor salivary gland biopsies. Recently, salivary biomarkers of SS has been investigated. The etiology of SS is still unclear. Since there is a familial aggregation of primary SS, however, genetic factors have been suspected for a long time.

Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA  is macrophage activation syndrome.

Most common disrupted pathways, both in HPV-mediated and HPV-independent penile carcinogenesis, involve the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 and/or p16INK4a/cyclin D/Rb pathways. HPVs exert their oncogenic effect by expressing the oncoproteins E6 and E7, which bind to and inactivate the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor gene products, respectively. HPV independent mechanisms of pathway inactivation include silencing of the p16INK4a gene by promoter hypermethylation, somatic mutations of the p53 gene, over-expression of MDM2 and mutation of p14ARF. Several other molecular events include alterations in the activity and/or expression of ras and myc genes, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX) pathway and prostaglandin E2 synthase.

The PrPSc form shows greater protease resistance than PrPC and accumulates in affected individuals, often in the form of extracellular plaques.

The prothrombin time is prolonged by 4-6 seconds or more. While the etiologies of FHF are multiple and varied, viral hepatitis is the most frequent cause. Around 40-60% of patients with FHF are thought to be due to some viral infection. The prognosis is dependent on several factors, including the underlying cause of liver failure. For instance, it is well known that the spontaneous recovery rates from FHF from such etiologies as hepatitis A and acetaminophen toxicity are high, whereas those same rates for other types of viral hepatitis and idiosyncratic drug reactions are quite low. Identification of the cause of FHF is important because some causes have specific treatment interventions or antidotes. Specific therapies include N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose, and acyclovir for herpesvirus infection. Different therapeutic options such as complete exchange blood transfusion, corticosteroids, and plasma pheresis, have been tried. However, the overall prognosis for patients with FHF is quite poor, with survival rates usually reported between 10% and 30% without liver transplantation.""",Liver disease,,,"""  Hepatitis A virus (HAV) [GN:T40068], HBV [GN:T40004], HCV [GN:T40066], HDV [GN:T40085], HEV [GN:T40067]""",Acetaminophen [DR:D00217],,"""Hyperbilirubinaemia, High activities of aminotransferases, Low values of coagulation factors""","""Corticosteroids, Acetylcysteine [DR:D00221] (for acetaminophen induced FHF)""","""See also H01506 Hepatic encephalopathy, H00411 Hepatitis A, H00412 Hepatitis B, H00413 Hepatitis C, H00414 Hepatitis D, and H00415 Hepatitis E.""","""ICD-10: K72, MeSH: D017114"""

HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in the genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies. The increase in the myfilament Ca2+ sensitivity well account for the diastolic dysfunction of model animals as well as human patients of HCM.

However, some meningiomas tend to be more aggressive with tendencies toward invasion of the surrounding brain, high propensity for recurrence, and in rare cases extracranial metastasis. Hereditary factors and ionizing radiation play an important role in the initiation of at least some meningiomas. Inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene is likely responsible for the initiation of more than half of all meningiomas and may cause a mesenchymal-like cytomorphology.

Such relationships, however, have not been documented. Treatment of cervical stenosis related to OLF is based on the standard principle of managing neural spinal abnormalities. Acute episodes of pain and onset of or increase in neurological deficits are treated with rest, external spinal immobilization with a collar or brace, and analgesics, anti-inflammatory, and/or antispasmodic medicines.

DEH probably is caused by atrophy or fibrous obliteration of the endolymphatic resorptive system of the membranous labyrinth. It has been reported that genetic factors may sometimes be the cause of this disease. Two types of DEH exist: the ipsilateral type, in which the ear with profound hearing loss suffers progressive endolymphatic hydrops, and the contralateral type, in which the formation of progressive endolymphatic hydrops takes place in the ear opposite to the previously deafened ear. DEH requires conservative treatment, such as that typically used for Meniere's disease, including the appropriate concomitant use of diuretics, such as isosorbide or steroids for at least 3-6 months.

HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).""",Cancer,"""N00223  EBV EBNA1 to host-cell-protein inhibition, N00224  EBV EBNALP binding to host-cell-protein, N00225  EBV EBNA2 binding to host-cell-protein, N00226  EBV EBNA3A/3B to host-cell-protein inhibition, N00262  EBV EBNA3C to host-cell-protein inhibition, N00263  EBV EBNA3C to host-cell-protein activation, N00264  EBV EBNA3C binding to host-cell-protein, N00265  EBV LMP1 to host-cell-protein activation, N00266  EBV LMP2 to host-cell-protein inhibition""","""IKBA (mutation) [HSA:4792] [KO:K04734], IKBE (mutation) [HSA:4794] [KO:K05872], c-rel (amplification) [HSA:5966] [KO:K09254], CD95 (mutation) [HSA:355] [KO:K04390]""",  Human herpesvirus 4 (Epstein-Barr virus) [GN:T40079],,,"""CD30 [HSA:943], IL-10 [HSA:3586]""","""Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) [DG:DG00696], Bleomycin [DG:DG00705], Vinblastine [DG:DG00689], Dacarbazine (ABVD) [DG:DG00680], Mechlorethamine [DR:D07671], Etoposide [DG:DG00693], Vincristine [DG:DG00690], Prednisone [DG:DG00094], Cyclophosphamide [DG:DG00675], Procarbazine [DG:DG00706], Prednisone [DG:DG00094]""","""ICD-O: 9650/3, Tumor type: Classical Hodgkin lymphoma, ICD-O: 9663/3, Tumor type: Nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin lymphoma, ICD-O: 9651/3, Tumor type: Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma, ICD-O: 9652/3, Tumor type: Mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin lymphoma, ICD-O: 9653/3, Tumor type: Lymphocyte-depleted classical Hodgkin lymphoma""","""ICD-10: C81, MeSH: D006689"""

Fallopian tube cancers are similar to ovarian cancer with respect to the proportion of tumors with abnormal expression of c-erbB-2 and p53. It has been proposed that the p53 signature is the earliest step in the pathogenesis of fallopian tube cancer. In this model, tubal epithelium on the fimbria experiences genotoxic damage and, as a result, the secretory cell exhibits over-accumulation of p53 protein (p53 signature).

Anterior pituitary is composed of five cell types that secrete growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and corticotropin hormone (ACTH). Clinical manifestations of hypopituitarism are variable, often insidious in onset and dependent on the degree and severity of hormone deficiency. However, it is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. A variety of diseases may cause hypopituitarism and, accordingly, this disorder can be divided into two types depending on its cause. Primary hypopituitarism is caused by disorders of the pituitary gland itself and may be due to the loss, damage, or dysfunction of pituitary hormone-secreting cells. On the other hand, secondary hypopituitarism is the result of diseases of the hypothalamus or pituitary stalk interrupting the nerve or vascular connections to the pituitary gland, thereby reducing the secretion of the pituitary hormones. Hypopituitarism can be easily diagnosed by measuring basal pituitary and target hormone levels. MR imaging of the hypothalamo-pituitary region may provide essential information. The most common causes of primary hypopituitarism are pituitary adenoma and complications from surgery or radiation therapy for the treatment of pituitary adenoma. In rare cases, hypopituitarism has been observed when the infection occurs. Sheehan's syndrome is hypopituitarism caused by the postpartum hemorrhage of the pituitary gland. In still rarer cases, solitary or complicated pituitary hormone deficiency syndromes may occur due to genetic causes and typically affect children.

Hereditary factors and ionizing radiation play an important role in the initiation of at least some meningiomas.

Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization. Other concomitant therapy can include the use of immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and the administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).""",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,,,,,,,Clobetasol [DR:D01272],"""Autoantigen: DSG1 [HSA:1828] [KO:K07596], DSG3 [HSA:1830] [KO:K07598]""","""ICD-10: L10, MeSH: D010392"""

The hallmark pathological findings are progressive myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, with a predilection for the right ventricle. A number of genetic studies have identified mutations in various components of the cardiac desmosome that have important roles in the pathogenesis of ARVC. Disruption of desmosomal function by defective proteins might lead to death of myocytes under mechanical stress. The myocardial injury may be accompanied by inflammation. Since regeneration of cardiac myocytes is limited, repair by fibrofatty replacement occurs. Several studies have implicated that desmosome dysfunction results in the delocalization and nuclear translocation of plakoglobin. As a result, competition between plakoglobin and beta-catenin will lead to the inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, resulting in a shift from a myocyte fate towards an adipocyte fate of cells. The ryanodine receptor plays a crucial part in electromechanical coupling by control of release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol.

Although the recurrence risk for congenital hydrocephalus excluding X-linked hydrocephalus is low, recently, a few genes for autosomal recessive congenital hydrocephalus have been identified.

Compared with Thomsen disease, Becker disease is more common, more insidious, and has initial symptoms that occur later in childhood. Two additional forms of myotonia congenita have been described: myotonia levior and fluctuating myotonia congenita.

Despite clinical features mimicking infection or multiple sclerosis, the discovery of the green hairy tongue and the green urine in SMON patients aroused researchers' interest and thereby began solving the cause of SMON. The green color was derived from a chelate compound of clioquinol with ferric iron. A large number of SMON were observed throughout Japan, and the total number of cases reached nearly 10,000 by 1970. After the governmental ban on the use of clioquinol in September 1970, there was a dramatic disappearance of new case of SMON.

No outbreak had been reported until 2007, when ZIKV spread further to the Pacific Island of Yap. In 2013, the second and largest outbreak occurred in French Polynesia. In 2015, ZIKV infection has been confirmed in 18 states of Brazil, and the geographical distribution of ZIKV has steadily broadened given the wide distribution of the mosquito vector. Clinical manifestations of infection include fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, arthralgia, malaise, myalgia, anorexia, rash, oedema, lymphadenopathy and diarrhoea. In most cases, the infection appeared mild and self-limiting, with a mean symptom duration of 3-6 days. Shock complications and haemorrhagic signs have not been reported. However, Guillain-Barre syndrome, a neurologic complication, was reported. Clinical and epidemiological study showed that there is a link between microcephaly and of Zika virus.

The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE).

It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown.

The overexpression of HER-2/neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways.  Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumour suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway.""",Cancer,"""N00032  Mutation-activated KRAS/NRAS to PI3K signaling pathway, N00034  ERBB2-overexpression to PI3K signaling pathway, N00070  Mutation-inactivated p16(INK4a) to p16-cell cycle G1/S, N00071  Deleted p16(INK4a) to p16-cell cycle G1/S, N00095  ERBB2-overexpression to EGF-Jak-STAT signaling pathway, N00104  Mutation-activated KRAS to RalGDS signaling pathway, N00115  Mutation-inactivated TP53 to transcription""","""K-ras (mutation) [HSA:3845] [KO:K07827], ERBB2 (overexpression) [HSA:2064] [KO:K05083], p16/INK4A (mutation, deletion, promoter methylation) [HSA:1029] [KO:K06621], p53 (mutation) [HSA:7157] [KO:K04451], SMAD4 (mutation) [HSA:4089] [KO:K04501], BRCA2 (germline mutation) [HSA:675] [KO:K08775], STK11 (germline mutation) [HSA:6794] [KO:K07298]""",,,Tobacco smoking and tobacco smoke,"""CA19-9 [GL:G12794], Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) [HSA:634] [KO:K06499]""","""Gemcitabine [DG:DG00688], Cisplatin [DR:D00275], Paclitaxel [DG:DG01430], Erlotinib [DG:DG00711], Fluorouracil [DG:DG00687], Leucovorin (FOLFOX4) [DR:D01211 D04715], Irinotecan [DG:DG00726], Oxaliplatin [DR:D01790]""","""ICD-O: 8500/3, Tumor type: Ductal adenocarcinoma""","""ICD-10: C25, MeSH: D010190"""

It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis.

Within mitochondria, mutant SOD1 may interfere with the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2, affect mitochondrial import by interfering with the translocation machinery (TOM/TIM), and generate toxic free radicals (ROS). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced within mitochondria, inhibit the function of EAAT2, the main glial glutamate transporter protein, responsible for most of the reuptake of synaptically released glutamate. Glutamate excess increases intracellular calcium, which enhances oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Mutant SOD1 can also trigger oxidative reactions , which can then cause damage through the formation of hydroxyl radicals or via nitration of tyrosine residues on proteins.

The symptoms are choreiform, involuntary movements, personality changes and dementia. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, full-length mHtt can interfere with BDNF vesicular transport on microtubules. This mutant protein also may lead to abnormal endocytosis and secretion in neurons, because normal Htt form a complex with the proteins Hip1, clathrin and AP2 that are involved in endocytosis. In addition, mHtt affects Ca2+ signaling by sensitizing InsP3R1 to activation by InsP3, stimulating NMDAR activity, and destabilizing mitochondrial Ca2+ handling. The mHtt translocates to the nucleus, where it forms intranuclear inclusions. Nuclear toxicity is believed to be caused by interference with gene transcription, leading to loss of transcription of neuroprotective molecules such as BDNF. While mHtt binds to p53 and upregulates levels of nuclear p53 as well as p53 transcriptional activity.

ANFH occurs mainly in young individuals between 30 and 50 years old. The clinical manifestations of ANFH, including pain on exertion, limping gait, and discrepancy in leg length, cause considerable disability. The etiology of ANFH is unknown, but previous studies have indicated that heritable thrombophilia and hypofibrinolysis, alcohol intake, and steroid use are risk factors for ANFH. Most cases are sporadic, but familial cases have been described. It has been reported Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) is a particular type of femoral head necrosis occurring in children. It is more common among boys, and bilateral involvement occurs in 8-24% of cases. The disease is usually diagnosed among children under age 14 years, with a peak onset between 5 and 8 years of age. There is delayed skeletal maturation and impaired growth. In addition to congenital abnormalities, LCPD is associated with greater risk of cardiovascular diseases and diseases of the blood. Most cases are sporadic, but familial cases have been described. It has been reported that COL2A1 mutations are associated with this disease.

The pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis is not fully understood but postulated mechanisms include hyperlipidemia, fat emboli and intravascular coagulation that reduce the supply of blood to the bones. Since not all patients who are treated with steroids develop osteonecrosis, the presence of additional risk factors or individual variation of glucocorticoids sensitivity has been suggested. The risks of this disease include advancing age, prolonged duration of treatment, increased daily dosage and cumulative dose, low body mass index, underlying disease, and polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor.

Nonetheless, the vast majority of DS births are to younger mothers.

Recent studies have linked the increased frequency of polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase gene (MTRR) in mothers with DS child. The phenotypic features of DS are quite variable from person to person and include learning disability, heart defects, early-onset Alzheimer's disease and childhood leukaemia.

The phenotypic features of DS are quite variable from person to person and include learning disability, heart defects, early-onset Alzheimer's disease and childhood leukaemia. This phenotypic variation is likely to be caused by a combination of environmental and genetic causes. Genetic polymorphisms in both Hsa21 and non-Hsa21 genes may account for much of this variation. Trisomy of Hsa21 has a significant impact on the development of many tissues, most notably the heart and the brain. A recent paper has suggested that RCAN1 and DYRK1A, localized in the Down syndrome critical region (DSCR) of HSA21, may have an impact on the development of multiple tissues.""",Chromosomal abnormality,,"""RCAN1 [HSA:1827] [KO:K17901], DYRK1A [HSA:1859] [KO:K08825], MTHFR (maternal polymorphism) [HSA:4524] [KO:K00297], MTRR (maternal polymorphism) [HSA:4552] [KO:K00597]""",,,,"""Alphafetoprotein (AFP), Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), Unconjungated estriol (uE3), Inhibin-A (serum screening), Amniotic diagnosis, Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT)""",,,"""ICD-10: Q90, MeSH: D004314, OMIM: 190685"""

Although the pathogenesis is still poorly understood, it has been reported that CCL11 and IL-9 were significantly increased in patients with atopic myelitis. Upregulation of CCL11 and IL-9 explain quite well the eosinophilic inflammation of the spinal cord.

It is characterized by ventricular dilatation. Although commonly considered a single disorder, hydrocephalus is a collection of a heterogeneous complex and multifactorial disorders. It may occur alone (non-syndromic) or as part of a syndrome with other anomalies. Almost 50% of all cases of hydrocephalus are congenital and these are usually associated with adverse neurological outcome. It is probably the consequence of abnormal brain development. Genetic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Molecular genetic studies have revealed that the responsible gene for X-linked human congenital hydrocephalus is encoding for L1CAM. Although the recurrence risk for congenital hydrocephalus excluding X-linked hydrocephalus is low, recently, a few genes for autosomal recessive congenital hydrocephalus have been identified. Besides genetic factors, many other factors influence the development of congenital hydrocephalus, such as congenital malformations, intracerebral hemorrhage, maternal alcohol use, infection, and X-ray radiation during pregnancy.""",Nervous system disease; Developmental disorder,,"""L1CAM [HSA:3897] [KO:K06550], CCDC88C [HSA:440193], MPDZ [HSA:8777] [KO:K06095]""",,,,,,See also H01034 L1 syndrome,"""ICD-10: Q03, MeSH: D006849, OMIM: 307000 236600 615219"""

The clinical manifestations of ANFH, including pain on exertion, limping gait, and discrepancy in leg length, cause considerable disability. The etiology of ANFH is unknown, but previous studies have indicated that heritable thrombophilia and hypofibrinolysis, alcohol intake, and steroid use are risk factors for ANFH. Most cases are sporadic, but familial cases have been described. It has been reported Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) is a particular type of femoral head necrosis occurring in children. It is more common among boys, and bilateral involvement occurs in 8-24% of cases. The disease is usually diagnosed among children under age 14 years, with a peak onset between 5 and 8 years of age. There is delayed skeletal maturation and impaired growth. In addition to congenital abnormalities, LCPD is associated with greater risk of cardiovascular diseases and diseases of the blood. Most cases are sporadic, but familial cases have been described. It has been reported that COL2A1 mutations are associated with this disease.

Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, full-length mHtt can interfere with BDNF vesicular transport on microtubules. This mutant protein also may lead to abnormal endocytosis and secretion in neurons, because normal Htt form a complex with the proteins Hip1, clathrin and AP2 that are involved in endocytosis. In addition, mHtt affects Ca2+ signaling by sensitizing InsP3R1 to activation by InsP3, stimulating NMDAR activity, and destabilizing mitochondrial Ca2+ handling. The mHtt translocates to the nucleus, where it forms intranuclear inclusions. Nuclear toxicity is believed to be caused by interference with gene transcription, leading to loss of transcription of neuroprotective molecules such as BDNF.

AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42.

Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in the genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies. The increase in the myfilament Ca2+ sensitivity well account for the diastolic dysfunction of model animals as well as human patients of HCM.

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal malformation in newborns. Throughout the world, the overall prevalence of DS is 1 per 1,000 live births, although in recent years this figure has been increasing. Roughly 95% of cases of DS are due to the presence of an extra (third) copy of HSA21.  Most often, the non-disjunction event leading to DS occurs in maternal meiosis I. In about 5% of patients, 1 copy is translocated to another acrocentric chromosome, most often chromosome 14 or 21. In 2 to 4% of cases with free trisomy 21 there is recognizable mosaicism for a trisomic and a normal cell line. DS occurs at a much higher incidence in older mothers. Nonetheless, the vast majority of DS births are to younger mothers. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that age independent DNA hypo-methylation is associated with chromosomal instability and abnormal segregation. Recent studies have linked the increased frequency of polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase gene (MTRR) in mothers with DS child. The phenotypic features of DS are quite variable from person to person and include learning disability, heart defects, early-onset Alzheimer's disease and childhood leukaemia. This phenotypic variation is likely to be caused by a combination of environmental and genetic causes. Genetic polymorphisms in both Hsa21 and non-Hsa21 genes may account for much of this variation. Trisomy of Hsa21 has a significant impact on the development of many tissues, most notably the heart and the brain.

Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

The predominant features of Thomsen disease are a painless, transient, muscle stiffness with a predilection for both the upper extremity and the facial muscles. Compared with Thomsen disease, Becker disease is more common, more insidious, and has initial symptoms that occur later in childhood. Two additional forms of myotonia congenita have been described: myotonia levior and fluctuating myotonia congenita.

If fluid continues to enlarge the cyst, the syrinx has the potential to compress or destroy the affected portions of the spinal cord. Surgical intervention is typically recommended to treat this condition, although a successful procedure often is limited to providing minimal neurological improvement or simply halting the deterioration. The term syringomyelia describes many pathogenetically different disorders. A popular broad grouping is a classification based on the assumed pathogenesis and association with other disorders. It has been proposed to divide the disorder into three subgroups. (1) Syringomyelia as a result of changed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics related to hindbrain disorders, e.g. Chiari malformation, Dandy-Walker syndrome, arachnoiditis or osseous abnormalities. (2) Syringomyelia as a result of intramedullary tissue damage caused by haemorrhage or infarction. (3) Syringomyelia as a result of intramedullary tumour with secretory capabilities.

The etiology of these diseases is thought to be associated with the conversion of a normal protein, PrPC, into an infectious, pathogenic form, PrPSc. The conversion is induced by prion infections (for example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), iatrogenic CJD, Kuru), mutations (familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia (FFI)) or unknown factors (sporadic CJD (sCJD)), and is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane or is re-internalized for degradation. The PrPSc form shows greater protease resistance than PrPC and accumulates in affected individuals, often in the form of extracellular plaques. Pathways that may lead to neuronal death comprise oxidative stress, regulated activation of complement, ubiquitin-proteasome and endosomal-lysosomal systems, synaptic alterations and dendritic atrophy, corticosteroid response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the oldest recognized eating disorder. The salient features of this eating disorder are a relentless pursuit of thinness, accompanied by a fear of becoming fat despite being markedly underweight. In women, anorexia nervosa is associated with global endocrine dysregulation, including hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction and alterations in adipokine and appetite regulating hormone levels. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is defined by eating behaviors that include episodes of binge eating which are followed by recurrent self-induced vomiting performed in an attempt to avoid weight gain from the caloric overload. Binge eating disorder (BED) is currently characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating occurring at least twice a week for 6 months or longer. In contrast to bulimia nervosa, there are no inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as vomiting. Eating disorders frequently develop during adolescence or early adulthood, but some studies have reported their onset during childhood or later in adulthood. There is growing evidence supporting a multifactorial etiology that includes genetic, neurochemical, and physiological components for eating disorders above and beyond the more conventional theories based on psychological and sociocultural factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in regulating nerves in the brain. Recent studies have provided evidence that BDNF also plays a role in regulating eating behaviors.

HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in the genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies. The increase in the myfilament Ca2+ sensitivity well account for the diastolic dysfunction of model animals as well as human patients of HCM.

The predominant form of sudden SNHL is unilateral in location, and the main aetiology is idiopathic. As the majority of patients (30-65 %) with unilateral sudden SNHL report spontaneous recovery within 2 weeks, unilateral disease is mostly regarded as a benign condition. Prognosis for recovery is dependent on a number of factors, including patient age, presence of vertigo at onset, degree of hearing loss, and time between onset of hearing loss and treatment. The pathology of sudden SNHL remains unclear. However, a series of factors, including viral infections, microcirculatory disorders, autoimmune disorders, and labyrinthine hemorrhage, have been proposed as causative factors.

Mutations of these loci have significant differences in phenotype and inheritance pattern. The most common genes associated with hyperinsulinism, involve the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes that encode the two subunits of the beta-cell ATP-dependent potassium channel. Recessive mutations of these genes cause a severe form of neonatal hypoglycemia that frequently requires near-total pancreatectomy. Diazoxide, a drug that acts as an agonist of the ATP-dependent potassium channel to suppress insulin secretion, is effective in defects associated with mutations of GLUD1 and HADHSC. Diazoxide is often ineffective in mutations of the ATP- dependent potassium channel and may not adequately control hypoglycemia in GCK or SLC16A1 mutations.""",Inherited metabolic disease,,"""(HHF1/ LIH) ABCC8 [HSA:6833] [KO:K05032], (HHF2) KCNJ11 [HSA:3767] [KO:K05004], (HHF3) GCK [HSA:2645] [KO:K12407], (HHF4) HADHSC [HSA:3033] [KO:K00022], (HHF5) INSR [HSA:3643] [KO:K04527], (HHF6) GLUD1 [HSA:2746] [KO:K00261], (HHF7) SLC16A1 [HSA:6566] [KO:K08179]""",,,,,Diazoxide [DR:D00294],Leucine-induced hypoglycemia (LIH),"""ICD-10: E16.1, MeSH: D006946, OMIM: 256450 601820 602485 609975 609968 606762 610021 240800"""

BE is characterized by the replacement of the normal squamous epithelium with the columnar epithelium, when the healing of the lesion occurs.

The genetic anomaly in X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome has been mapped to Xq26, and resides in mutations of the CD40 ligand gene. Missense mutation in exon 7 of the common gamma chain (IL2RG) causes a moderate form of X-linked CID. This point mutation in IL2RG leads to a less severe degree of deficiency in cellular and humoral immunity than that seen in XSCID. Two related deficiencies of recombination activating genes, RAG1 and RAG2 result in a spectrum of SCID called RAG1/RAG2 deficiency and Omenn syndrome. Mutations that lead to total absence of RAG1 or RAG2 gene product (null mutations) are known to lead to SCID without mature lymphoid cells, whereas mutations that result in partial V(D)J recombinase activity due to missense mutation on at least one allele lead to Omenn syndrome.

Defective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules account for 5% of SCID.

HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).""",Cancer,"""N00223  EBV EBNA1 to host-cell-protein inhibition, N00224  EBV EBNALP binding to host-cell-protein, N00225  EBV EBNA2 binding to host-cell-protein, N00226  EBV EBNA3A/3B to host-cell-protein inhibition, N00262  EBV EBNA3C to host-cell-protein inhibition, N00263  EBV EBNA3C to host-cell-protein activation, N00264  EBV EBNA3C binding to host-cell-protein, N00265  EBV LMP1 to host-cell-protein activation, N00266  EBV LMP2 to host-cell-protein inhibition""","""IKBA (mutation) [HSA:4792] [KO:K04734], IKBE (mutation) [HSA:4794] [KO:K05872], c-rel (amplification) [HSA:5966] [KO:K09254], CD95 (mutation) [HSA:355] [KO:K04390]""",  Human herpesvirus 4 (Epstein-Barr virus) [GN:T40079],,,"""CD30 [HSA:943], IL-10 [HSA:3586]""","""Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) [DG:DG00696], Bleomycin [DG:DG00705], Vinblastine [DG:DG00689], Dacarbazine (ABVD) [DG:DG00680], Mechlorethamine [DR:D07671], Etoposide [DG:DG00693], Vincristine [DG:DG00690], Prednisone [DG:DG00094], Cyclophosphamide [DG:DG00675], Procarbazine [DG:DG00706], Prednisone [DG:DG00094]""","""ICD-O: 9650/3, Tumor type: Classical Hodgkin lymphoma, ICD-O: 9663/3, Tumor type: Nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin lymphoma, ICD-O: 9651/3, Tumor type: Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma, ICD-O: 9652/3, Tumor type: Mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin lymphoma, ICD-O: 9653/3, Tumor type: Lymphocyte-depleted classical Hodgkin lymphoma""","""ICD-10: C81, MeSH: D006689"""

Type 4 RTA is a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with hyperkalemia due to aldosterone deficiency or impairment in aldosterone molecular signaling. Primary pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is characterized by salt-wasting, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis in the presence of markedly elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration. In the autosomal dominant form, aldosterone resistance is due to heterozygous mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene. In the autosomal recessive form, aldosterone resistance is caused by loss-of-function homozygous mutations in the genes encoding one of the three constitutive subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) of the epithelial Na+ channel (SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G). Other inherited cause of type 4 RTA includes hyperkalaemia associated with hypertension and low or normal levels of plasma aldosterone. This syndrome is called pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHA2), or Gordon's syndrome, which results in a renal aldosterone resistance. Mutations in the genes encoding WNK1 and WNK4 kinases (WNK1 and WNK4), which regulate ion-transportors on renal tubules, were identified in patients with PHA2.

The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as  microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX.

Classification of MPGN has been updated in the 2010s, and is now categorized according to the immunofluorescence microscopy findings. Until recently, the MPGNs have been distinguished according to the histological and ultra structural findings and were classified as MPGN type I, type II and type III. A new terminology that distinguishes immunoglobulin-mediated MPGN (ie, the former type I) from complement-mediated MPGN has been proposed. Immune-complexes mediated MPGN is caused by the deposition of immunocomplexes in the glomeruli. The immunocomplexes activate the classical pathway (CP) of complement and cause the deposition of complement factors or of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the mesangium and capillary loops. The most frequent underlying disorders associated with immune complex MPGN include chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and monoclonal gammopathies. The complement-mediated MPGN, termed C3 glomerulopathy, is characterised by defects in the alternative pathway of complement, in particular of factor H, or autoantibodies to complement-regulatory proteins (so-called C3 nephritic factors) leading to increased complement activation. The group includes dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis.

The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs.

Primary pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is characterized by salt-wasting, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis in the presence of markedly elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration. In the autosomal dominant form, aldosterone resistance is due to heterozygous mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene. In the autosomal recessive form, aldosterone resistance is caused by loss-of-function homozygous mutations in the genes encoding one of the three constitutive subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) of the epithelial Na+ channel (SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G). Other inherited cause of type 4 RTA includes hyperkalaemia associated with hypertension and low or normal levels of plasma aldosterone. This syndrome is called pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHA2), or Gordon's syndrome, which results in a renal aldosterone resistance. Mutations in the genes encoding WNK1 and WNK4 kinases (WNK1 and WNK4), which regulate ion-transportors on renal tubules, were identified in patients with PHA2.

HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in the genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality.

Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA  is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the oldest recognized eating disorder. The salient features of this eating disorder are a relentless pursuit of thinness, accompanied by a fear of becoming fat despite being markedly underweight. In women, anorexia nervosa is associated with global endocrine dysregulation, including hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction and alterations in adipokine and appetite regulating hormone levels. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is defined by eating behaviors that include episodes of binge eating which are followed by recurrent self-induced vomiting performed in an attempt to avoid weight gain from the caloric overload. Binge eating disorder (BED) is currently characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating occurring at least twice a week for 6 months or longer. In contrast to bulimia nervosa, there are no inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as vomiting. Eating disorders frequently develop during adolescence or early adulthood, but some studies have reported their onset during childhood or later in adulthood. There is growing evidence supporting a multifactorial etiology that includes genetic, neurochemical, and physiological components for eating disorders above and beyond the more conventional theories based on psychological and sociocultural factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in regulating nerves in the brain. Recent studies have provided evidence that BDNF also plays a role in regulating eating behaviors.

Two types of HIV has been characterized. HIV-1 is the most virulent and pathogenic strain. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.""",Infectious disease,,,"""  Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) [GN:T40001], Human immunodeficiency virus 2 (HIV-2) [GN:T40002]""",,,,"""Zidovudine [DR:D00413] Didanosine [DR:D00296] Zalcitabine [DR:D00412] Sanilvudine [DR:D00445] Lamivudine [DR:D00353] Abacavir [DR:D00891] Emtricitabine [DR:D01199] Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [DR:D01982] (NRTIs), Nevirapine [DR:D00435] Efavirenz [DR:D00896] Delavirdine [DR:D00895] Etravirine [DR:D04112] Rilpivirine [DR:D09958] (NNRTIs), Ritonavir [DR:D00427] Nelfinavir [DR:D00899] Saquinavir [DR:D01160] Fosamprenavir [DR:D02867] (PIs), Raltegravir [DR:D07133] Dolutegravir [DR:D10113] (Integra",See also H00406 Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).,"""ICD-10: B24, MeSH: D015658"""

One prominent theory regarding the pathogenesis is that bile duct injury is initially caused by a viral infection, and then perpetuated by an autoimmune disorder.

Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks.

JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly.

The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.
